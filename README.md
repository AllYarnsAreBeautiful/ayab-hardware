This is the respository for the open-source first-party hardware that interfaces with the AYAB desktop 
software. The project started with the original AYAB Shield, which mounts to an Arduino Uno style board. 
The shield does not fit inside the machine and it must remain open while the AYAB-Shield is installed. This 
design was later incorporated into a replacement PCB to be installed into the knitting machine, called the 
AYAB-Interface, and was designed and produced by Evil Mad Scientist Labs (EMSL). In anticipation of the new 
generation of AYAB software with the launch of v1.0, we have also started design on a new, fully integrated 
ESP32 board which would replace the internal motherboard of the knitting machine.
