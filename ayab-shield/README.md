# AYAB Shield
This is the original design for the AYAB hardware. It is a board in a shield form factor intended to be used with Arduino Uno type development boards. It should be compatible with Uno R2, R3, and R4. 
This shield can be built in a variety of configurations that allow for compatibility with Brother KH 270, 900, 910, 930, 940, 950, 965.

The files required to order/build the board can be found in the Releases on the sidebar, but you can also find workflow artifacts for unvalidated hardware based on the state of the repo.

The project was designed using KiCad 9. All symbols, footprints, and 3D models are self-contained to the repository.
